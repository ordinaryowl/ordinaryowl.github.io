Following the unwritten rule about beginning with a `Hello World`, let's add `something` to this website.

Let's use the following python snippet to create `something`: 

{% highlight ruby %}
def create(something):
  return something

something=create('nothing')

print('successfully created' + something)
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the my [GitHub Projects][Git-Projects], assuming there is something.
